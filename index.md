Use this document as a way to quickly start any new project.

All you get is this text and a mostly barebones HTML document.

This is a sample `code` test. Because `c++` rocks! I am talking a lot of nonsense over here simply because I want to see how the code looks when you have a line break. To accomplish this, I need a super long line. Can someone help me with multiple copy-pasta? Copy-linguini? Lasagna? I think this is long enough.

``` ruby
reader = Reader.new

reader.wait do |done|
  unless done
    puts "Got to wait...nevertheless, feel free to peruse the site so far..."
  end
end
```

```
No language in particular.

Text should be clear.

Yay!
```

<pre>
A true preformatted box.

We like the way this clear text looks.

Hurrah!
